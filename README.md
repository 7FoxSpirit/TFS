Sum of Large Range of Numbers using Pandas

      This Python code calculates the sum of a large range of numbers using the Pandas library. It creates a Series object containing the numbers from 0 to 1499999999 and then calculates the sum of those numbers using the .sum() method of the Series object. The execution time of the code is also measured using the time module.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites

     Before running the code, you need to ensure that the following software is installed on your computer:

     Python (version 3.7 or higher)
     Pandas library (version 1.0.0 or higher)
Installation

    You can install Pandas using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
                       pip install pandas
    This will install the latest version of Pandas.

      Thanks to the creators of the Pandas library for providing an efficient way to work with large data sets in Python.

Whats happening with in the code:

       This Python code uses the Pandas library to create a Series object containing the numbers from 0 to 1499999999, and then calculates the sum of those numbers using the .sum() method of the Series object. The execution time of the code is also measured using the time module.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

       import pandas as pd - imports the Pandas library and renames it as pd for convenience.

       import time - imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions.

       start = time.time() - records the start time of the code execution.

       arr = pd.Series(range(0, 1500000000)) - creates a Pandas Series object containing the numbers from 0 to 1499999999.

       total = arr.sum() - calculates the sum of the numbers in the Series object using the .sum() method.

       print('sum is:', total) - prints the sum of the numbers.

       end = time.time() - records the end time of the code execution.

       print(end - start) - prints the execution time of the code.

Overall, this code provides an efficient way to calculate the sum of a large range of numbers using the Pandas library, which is optimized for handling large datasets.
